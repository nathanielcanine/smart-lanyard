This is an Arduino project I've been working on. 

Background
1. I needed a final project for my Electronics II class.
2. My school requires that students wear lanyards.
3. I never seem to have paper or pencil when I need to write/draw something out.

To solve my problem, I ordered a TFT LCD touchscreen shield and an Arduino Uno (I call it the Ardi-Uno). I put them together and although I don't end up doing much circuitry, I do a lot of code for the project. Starting with a basic paint sample program, I updated it with more colors and pen sizes and made it more functional in general (clear, eraser). Then I realized that I can add a lot more stuff. Time functions, games, calculators, etc.

Cost:
Arduino Uno $25
Elegoo TFT Shield $25 (I got mine on sale, $15)
Oenbopo 12000mAh Power Bank $20 (I got mine on sale, $10)
16gb sanDisk microSD card $8

You can always find cheaper sources.

Short Term Goals (in order of priority)
Snake App
Menu Screen (with background photo?)
Calculator App
Clock App (timer, stopwatch, etc.)
file upload?

Long Term Goals
Bluetooth Connection to phone or laptop for time/weather
Run entire thing with Arduino Uno Trinket? Brings cost down by $20 dollars.

v 1.0
Smart Lanyard
* Paint Program: 7 colors: ROYGBV + black. 6 pen sizes, clear button, eraser, and background color set.
